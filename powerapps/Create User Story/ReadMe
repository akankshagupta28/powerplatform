Use Case Description:
    In an ongoing Project, there is a requirement where End User should be able to raise a ticket whenever they face any issue. 
    That issue will create a Backlog item in Azure DevOps. End User should receive ticket number which will be the User Story number.
    All the issues raised will be stored in backend as well so that they can be used for reporting or tracking purpose.
    
For this, I used Canvas Power App, Instant Power Automate Flow and access to an Azure DevOps board.
